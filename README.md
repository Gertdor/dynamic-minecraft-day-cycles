# Dynamic Minecraft Day Cycles
A serverside Spigot plugin to allow for more configurable day/night cycles in minecraft.

## Features
Dynamic Day Cycles aims to be a powerful tool for any Minecraft Spigot server that wishes to change the length or structure of their day cycles. No matter if they wish to multiply the length of the days, or if they wish to change the ratio between night or day Dynamic Day Cycles provides an easy to use tool for server owners with any experience.

### Day cycle length configuration
The plugin comes with three different ways of defining the Minecraft day cycle with different structure and ease of use. The three ways are;

* Multiplying length with a multiplier
* Defining static values for all parts of the day
* Using generated day, dawn, dusk, and night length based on a geographical position and a day of the year.

### Client side commands
To allow easy access from within the client Dynamic Day Cycles gives users access to all functionality within the plugin from simple commands. Define how you want your cycles to be handled, cycle to the next day, or pause the cycle completely. Naturally commands come with permissions built in to hinder certain users to abuse the power of the plugin.
